# Hi, Obaidul Haque 👋
**`obaidulsaiki (aspiring_Ml_engineer_and_developer)`**

I’m an expert in Java and Python with strong skills in JavaScript, PHP, SQL, C++, and C. I have hands-on experience in research and practical project development, tackling various challenges across various domains. I'm passionate about solving problems with code or exploring new technologies. The thing I like most is developing something from scratch. In my free time, I try to build systems and projects.
